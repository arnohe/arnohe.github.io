# About Me

Hi there! I'm Arno Heirman, an aspiring computer vision engineer who is fascinated by the intricacies of software and how it unlocks solutions that can make a real difference.

Equipped with a strong foundation in Python (TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy) and machine learning principles honed through my Master's research on melanoma detection, I'm eager to apply my skills for positive change.

Looking to start my career as a Computer Vision Engineer, I'm excited to learn and contribute to innovative projects, particularly in fields with a significant impact on human health and well-being.

Beyond puzzles and problems, I find inspiration in the intricate details of nature.
When I'm not tinkering with software projects, you'll find me outdoors birdwatching, every sighting cultivates my focus and curiosity.
